Creating a game engine is a substantial project, and it's important to approach it step by step. Given your requirements, I'll outline a plan for a basic 2D game engine that can be extended to support 3D graphics in the future. Since you want to be hands-off in the design and planning phase, I'll make decisions on your behalf, but feel free to jump in at any time with your input.

### Phase 1: Design and Planning

1. **Engine Architecture:**

   - **Core Module:** Main loop, initialization, and shutdown.
   - **Rendering Module:** 2D rendering with future support for 3D.
   - **Input Module:** Handling user inputs.
   - **Physics Module:** Basic collision detection for 2D (extendable to 3D).
   - **Audio Module:** Sound effects and music playback.

2. **Technology Stack:**

   - **Language:** C++.
   - **Graphics Library:** SDL2 for 2D rendering (with potential to integrate OpenGL for 3D).
   - **Audio Library:** SDL2_mixer or OpenAL.
   - **Physics:** Custom lightweight physics for 2D, with potential to integrate a library like Bullet for 3D.

3. **Development Environment:** Visual Studio or Code::Blocks with the necessary libraries installed.

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. **Core Module:**

   - Implement the main loop.
   - Implement initialization and shutdown procedures.

2. **Rendering Module:**

   - Set up SDL2 and create a window.
   - Implement basic 2D rendering functions.
   - Design the module to allow easy extension to 3D with OpenGL.

3. **Input Module:**

   - Implement input handling for keyboard and mouse.

4. **Physics Module:**

   - Implement basic 2D collision detection.
   - Design the module to be extendable to 3D.

5. **Audio Module:**
   - Implement audio playback functions using the chosen audio library.

### Phase 3: Testing and Debugging

- Test each module individually and then together as a whole.
- Debug any issues that arise during testing.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Future Planning

- Document the engine's architecture, modules, and usage.
- Plan for future features and improvements, including 3D support.

### Next Steps:

- Set up your development environment and install the necessary libraries.
- Start with the implementation of the Core Module.

### Core Module Example Code:

Below is a simplified example of how you might start coding the Core Module:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class GameEngine {
public:
    void Start() {
        Initialize();
        GameLoop();
        Shutdown();
    }

private:
    void Initialize() {
        std::cout << "Initialization code here" << std::endl;
    }

    void GameLoop() {
        std::cout << "Main game loop here" << std::endl;
        while (true) {
            // Update and render game
            // Break the loop when the game ends
        }
    }

    void Shutdown() {
        std::cout << "Shutdown code here" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    GameEngine engine;
    engine.Start();
    return 0;
}
```

### Implementation Details:

- Each module should be implemented in separate source and header files.
- Use object-oriented principles to design each module.
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.

### Your Role:

- Since you want to be hands-on during the debugging phase, your role will be to review the code, test it, and debug any issues that arise.

Shall we proceed with the Core Module implementation, or do you have any modifications or suggestions before we start?
