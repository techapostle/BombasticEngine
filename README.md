Creating a game engine is a substantial project, and it's important to approach it step by step. Given your requirements, I'll outline a plan for a basic 2D game engine that can be extended to support 3D graphics in the future. Since you want to be hands-off in the design and planning phase, I'll make decisions on your behalf, but feel free to jump in at any time with your input.

### Phase 1: Design and Planning

1. **Engine Architecture:**

   - **Core Module:** Main loop, initialization, and shutdown.
   - **Rendering Module:** 2D rendering with future support for 3D.
   - **Input Module:** Handling user inputs.
   - **Physics Module:** Basic collision detection for 2D (extendable to 3D).
   - **Audio Module:** Sound effects and music playback.

2. **Technology Stack:**

   - **Language:** C++.
   - **Graphics Library:** SDL2 for 2D rendering (with potential to integrate OpenGL for 3D).
   - **Audio Library:** SDL2_mixer or OpenAL.
   - **Physics:** Custom lightweight physics for 2D, with potential to integrate a library like Bullet for 3D.

3. **Development Environment:** Visual Studio or Code::Blocks with the necessary libraries installed.

### Phase 2: Implementation

1. **Core Module:**

   - Implement the main loop.
   - Implement initialization and shutdown procedures.

2. **Rendering Module:**

   - Set up SDL2 and create a window.
   - Implement basic 2D rendering functions.
   - Design the module to allow easy extension to 3D with OpenGL.

3. **Input Module:**

   - Implement input handling for keyboard and mouse.

4. **Physics Module:**

   - Implement basic 2D collision detection.
   - Design the module to be extendable to 3D.

5. **Audio Module:**
   - Implement audio playback functions using the chosen audio library.

### Phase 3: Testing and Debugging

- Test each module individually and then together as a whole.
- Debug any issues that arise during testing.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Future Planning

- Document the engine's architecture, modules, and usage.
- Plan for future features and improvements, including 3D support.

### Next Steps:

- Set up your development environment and install the necessary libraries.
- Start with the implementation of the Core Module.

### Core Module Example Code:

Below is a simplified example of how you might start coding the Core Module:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class GameEngine {
public:
    void Start() {
        Initialize();
        GameLoop();
        Shutdown();
    }

private:
    void Initialize() {
        std::cout << "Initialization code here" << std::endl;
    }

    void GameLoop() {
        std::cout << "Main game loop here" << std::endl;
        while (true) {
            // Update and render game
            // Break the loop when the game ends
        }
    }

    void Shutdown() {
        std::cout << "Shutdown code here" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    GameEngine engine;
    engine.Start();
    return 0;
}
```

### Implementation Details:

- Each module should be implemented in separate source and header files.
- Use object-oriented principles to design each module.
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.

### Core Modules

- Game Engine: The core class which runs the engine
- Rendering Engine: The class which uses SDL to initialize and render the window

### Modules

Great! Now that we have the core and rendering modules set up, we can proceed with the following modules:

### 1. **Input Handling Module:**

- This module will handle user inputs from various devices like keyboard, mouse, or game controllers.
- We can create classes like `InputManager` to abstract the input handling process.

### 2. **Audio Module:**

- Implementing an audio module using OpenAL or another suitable library to play background music, sound effects, etc.
- We can create classes like `AudioManager` to manage audio resources and playback.

### 3. **Physics Module:**

- Implementing basic 2D physics for movement, collision detection, and response.
- We might need classes for `RigidBody`, `Collider`, etc.

### 4. **Scene Management:**

- Implementing a system to manage different game scenes or levels.
- Classes like `SceneManager`, `Scene`, or `GameObject` might be necessary.

### 5. **Asset Management:**

- Developing a system to efficiently load, store, and retrieve game assets like textures, audio files, etc.
- Consider creating an `AssetManager` class for this purpose.

### 6. **GUI System:**

- Implementing a system for creating and managing in-game user interfaces, menus, buttons, etc.

### 7. **Scripting (Optional):**

- The engine will use Lua for scripting.
